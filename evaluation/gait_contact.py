"""Contact detection for cutting a continuous trace into gait cycles.

Every segmenter in this project used to do the same thing: threshold the raw
vertical GRF at 0.1 BW and take the rising edges as heelstrikes. That is one
comparison against one number on an unfiltered signal, and it fails whenever the
trace dips through the threshold mid-stance -- a false heelstrike, which cuts a
stance phase into a "cycle" that never unloads.

That failure was measured, not assumed: 48 of GaitNet's 424 walking cycles are
such fragments (13/57 at 0.8 m/s, 26/145 at 1.0, 9/145 at 1.2), each about half
the duration of a real cycle at the same speed. The existing `_single_grf_block`
screen cannot catch them -- it counts *extra* rising edges, and a fragment that
never unloads has none.

Three things are done here, in order:

  filter       the contact signal is low-passed before it is compared to
               anything. This is a DETECTION signal only -- the stored GRF is
               never filtered, so no reported curve is smoothed by this module.

  hysteresis   contact turns on at `on_bw` and off at the lower `off_bw`, so a
               dip has to be a real unloading, not a graze past one number, to
               end a stance phase.

  debounce     stance or flight phases shorter than `min_phase_s` are absorbed
               into their neighbour. Real toe-off/heelstrike events are tens of
               milliseconds apart at the very least.

and then `cycle_bounds` applies a duration guard relative to the trace's OWN
median cycle, which is what catches a fragment that survives all three: a
0.7 s cycle is obviously wrong beside a 1.28 s median, while an absolute bound
loose enough for both walking and running cannot see it.

The defaults are deliberately conservative: on data with no dip artefact they
reproduce the plain rising-edge result exactly (verified against the whole
GaitDynamics set, 594 cycles, unchanged).

# or a real unloading that bottoms out at, say, 0.058 BW never turns contact

# soft swing floor around 0.06 BW, so 0.05 produced false negatives; 0.07 clears
# it while staying well under ON_BW. Measured on the 594-cycle GaitDynamics set:
# at 0.07 every one of the 15 heelstrikes this module removes is preceded by a

# the screen of last resort for a stance fragment, and unlike DUR_BAND it does
# not depend on the rest of the trace being sane -- which matters, because the
# relative guard inverts on a rollout where the junk cycles are the majority and

# rollout yielded exactly two cycles, a duty-0.96 fragment and a duty-0.10 fall,

    than one discrete contact phase.

    Same idea as `data_exploration_main.ipynb`'s `_is_not_2_peaks` exclusion
    criterion (drop trials with a spurious extra contact burst), but built on
    `contact_mask`'s hysteresis+lowpass+debounce rather than a raw single
    threshold: a raw 0.10 BW crossing flags ~40% of the published Falisse
    2022 benchmark as "bad", almost all of it boundary noise where the last
    frame sits a few thousandths above threshold as the next heelstrike
    starts loading in -- exactly the false-positive case hysteresis exists to
    reject (see the module docstring).

    A well-formed heelstrike-first cycle is already in contact at frame 0, so
    a clean single stance region produces ZERO internal rising edges in the
    debounced mask; a solve that lands on a bad local optimum can still
    report `converged == True` (IPOPT "Solved_To_Acceptable_Level") while its
    GRF trace shows a genuine spurious extra contact burst mid-cycle -- that
    shows up as >=1 rising edge here and gets dropped. `fs` should be the
    trial's own sampling rate (FS / dur), matching `contact_mask`'s other
    callers, so the debounce window scales to the trial's actual gait-cycle
    duration rather than assuming a fixed frame rate.

    A "heelstrike-first" storage convention means the frame-0/frame-(n-1)
    array boundary sits exactly ON the loading transition itself -- the worst
    possible place for it. `_lowpass`'s zero-phase filter has no data outside
    [0, n) to support that edge, so the last frame or two routinely lands a
    few thousandths either side of `on_bw` as the (same) next heelstrike
    loads in, and the hysteresis walk misreads it as a second, spurious
    contact phase. Rolling the trace half a cycle before detection moves that
    boundary into the middle of the opposite (well-supported, near-zero or
    near-peak) phase instead, so the expected count becomes 1 genuine rising
    edge rather than 0 -- an extra, real burst mid-cycle still adds a second.
